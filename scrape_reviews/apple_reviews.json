I was upgraded from iPhone X and it was great experience with all the latest specs and flawlessly smooth. Thanks to all new A14 Bionic chip.Build quality was great as always from Apple.Phone feels light on hands due to aluminium body. I chose Blue colour because wanted to go for different colour than routine Black and white iPhones so initially I was bit skeptical but after seeing the phone in person I\u2019m happy with the blue colour \u201c not bad at all and not too flashy\u201dGrip and feel perfect. Phone comes with iOS 14.1. Camera quality was excellent and sufficient as a normal user.If you are from iOS ecosystem nothing will go wrong here.There is nothing to question about the quality and interface from Apple ( it\u2019s my personal opinion as a long time apple user)As you all know iPhone 12 won\u2019t comes with earphones and charging brick( adapter)I bought separately 20w apple adapter from new Apple India online store for Rs.1900I don\u2019t judge here apple because of accessories removal and the price tag. I hope apple can justify this.I only hope and wanted to see so badly Made in India IPhones so that we all can enjoy lower priced ( at least a better priced) iPhones in the future.A big thanks to Appario Retail Pvt. Ltd and Amazon for delivering genuine iPhone as always in perfect condition. Delivered way before the promised date.Update: (01/12/2020) After testing 25 days especially on battery life of this iPhone 12, results were amazing and I\u2019m completely satisfied with the battery performance. On Moderate gaming, Moderate Video Content, heavy on calls and heavy on browsing this iPhone 12 battery life is sufficient for your regular Day.My conclusion is definitely a better and improved battery performer than the previous iPhone model.Thank you Apple IndiaThank you Appario Retail Pvt. Ltd.Thank you Amazon India.( Note: charger brick was shown in my video was bought myself from Apple India online store because it won\u2019t comes with the phone)"},

It\u2019s a seemingly average phone which is over priced by 4 to 5 times at least. This phone is a joke in comparison with any Samsung flagship phone. I am shocked that so many fools like me are falling for apple\u2019s trickery and gimmickry.The battery doesn\u2019t last half a day. Screen size is average. Thickness of this phone will constantly remind you that this phone belongs to another era. 64gb space won\u2019t be enough for anyone.And then there are other apple quirks - won\u2019t come with a SD card, won\u2019t come with a charging brick or a set of head phones. Your headphones with the regular audio pin won\u2019t work with this one. Face ID won\u2019t work with masks on. So your forced to remove your masks when you\u2019re out and vulnerable. This phone won\u2019t allow you set google maps as default. So you continue to suffer using their apple map which I bet even Tim Cook doesn\u2019t use. You won\u2019t be able to set google chrome as your default browser as iOS won\u2019t let you.Overall the phone is overpriced and overrated. Anybody with half the wit will figure that this phone is a joke and a mere marketing gimmick. An ordinary phone like this shouldn\u2019t cost you more than 12 to 14K.Apple is going down!Amazon won\u2019t take this phone back as they have a 10 day return policy. So I am pretty much stuck with this damn excuse for a phone till I get to upgrade to a Samsung phone."},

{"name": "RakhuNathan", "stars": "4", "title": "Not Really worth the money", "review": "I have been an android user for the past 8+ years. Recently was using iphone 6 for the past few months, liked it much and wanted to switch to ios. I did not want to regret, so i purchased the best in the market, going with iphone 12. Honestly, I dont feel its worthy. Perfomance wise, its good. A lot other phones like MI, 1+ everything gives us a very nice perfomance too. The A14 chip is just a tag line to sell the phone. Are we really going to process million instructions per second on a mobile phone? Defenitely not.Battery, After charging it to 100% in the morning, I am hardly getting 1 full day with average use. My battery is almost 20% at the end of the day with a screentime of 4-4.3 hours[Update : With low power mode, it makes a 6 hour day, ending with 30%]. Camera quality is amazing in natural light. Yes, as specified it works so nice in night light, but please dont mistake night light as no-light. Front camera is still average. The same things i see in every other mid range android phones. I am still using JIO 4g. Not sure how this would work on 5g (must drain even faster)Face detenction, the color of the phone, Water resistant and all stuffs are nice to have, fancy items. But not really convinced if this is all we get for 84k?Fast charging - I bought a 20W charger from apple store for Rs.1900. I plug in when the battery is 20-25% and it takes 1.45 hours to reach 100%. If this is all about fast charging you are looking for, well and good. I never tried with magsafe, honestly. But this to me doesnt seem fast charging for 2800~ mah battery.I wont say that this phone is too poor. It gives us all that it promises. Personally I dont recommend investing 85k Indian money into this. Either go for lower versions of other iphones like 11 or you can wait for an year and buy this at cheaper cost.PROS : Camera & PerfomanceCONS : Battery and Cost"},

{"name": "Good vegetable", "stars": "4", "title": "How to decide between iPhone 11 and 12", "review": "After thinking a lot, I decided to go ahead with iPhone 12. The original price is \u20b9 84900. After credit card discount(\u20b96000), old phone exchange(\u20b93450) and reward points money(\u20b94530) inclusion, I bought it for \u20b970920. There\u2019s also an additional 3000 discount on red and white variants but I couldn\u2019t let go of blue1. PRICE: Considering iPhone 11 would be supported by iOS for 4 years, based on the current price it\u2019d cost 13k per year and iPhone 12 for 5 years would cost 14.9k(excluding exchange discount) per year. For me price gap for both phones didn\u2019t seem to make a huge difference as IPhone 11 is already an year old and costing only a 2k less per year.2: DISPLAY: I\u2019ve purchased iPhone 11 for my mom last year and been observing the display for some months. Compared to iPhone 11, the iPhone 12 display is far superior and has better pixel quality.3: BEZELS: the bezels of iPhone 12 are much thinner and makes the phone look decent unlike in 11. Apart from this, the phone is incredibly light making it easy to hold it.How to choose between 64/128gb:If you\u2019re not really tight on budget, I\u2019d suggest to go for 128gb variant. I\u2019ve been using one plus for 1.5 years and storage occupied about 60gb. So it\u2019d make good sense to check your current phone usage. Either way you can also opt for iCloud 50gb storage which would cost approximately the difference amount of 64 and 128 go for 5 years.CONS:1. Could have definitely included the charger for the price2. If you\u2019re an android user, migration would be little time consumingUpdate: I\u2019ve uploaded a couple of pictures shot using automatic night mode. :)"},

{"name": "Abhishek James", "stars": "5", "title": "For first time iPhone Users", "review": "When the iPhone 11 prices were announced, I was in a dilemma whether to go for the 11 or wait for 12. And since it was my first iPhone, I thought why not get the 12. The logic being: The phone will last for a couple of years (provided you don't drop it often), and if you are looking for a phone for a long time horizon, then go for the 12. This one with the better chip and the display will be able to handle the upcoming updates as well the apps which will get even more intensive in the future.All technical specs are really good, display is an OLED one, even visible in extreme sunlight. Build quality is miles apart, my brother uses a Samsung Galaxy Note 10+, and holding this one is way way out of the leagues of all the android phones. Processor and RAM are capable of even running multiple intensive applications, I had Adobe LightRoom, iMovie, and a couple of apps open, all to slide between them seamlessly. The trick here is that since apps are only made for a very few iPhones and iOS versions, these apps are hardware integrated, hence work better. A classic example is Instagram. Instagram does feel a bit more polished on the iPhone than android. FaceID even works when there's no light, so thats that. But it can't identify you with the mask, you're left to the PIN when you're in the outside.The Battery: Yes it has a smaller battery, yes with intensive use it will run out in a day, but if you are a bit prudent with it, it'll definitely last for more than a day. I use 4G in between, outdoor photography a bit, editing, email, Apple Music, Youtube, WhatsApp and Instagram. By the end of the day (7:00 PM) , I usually have 40 percent remaining.So yes, its an iPhone and yes its really something nice to hold and use daily."},

Worth buying or not?\"", "review": "From owner POV, It's completely different experience for me as I've come from a long line of android platform. But the UI is very attractive. I think it surpassed my expectations as a consumer. But as a rational thinker, 79k is a lot for a phone which carry a little amount of specs ships. I'm lucky that I have a Amazon business account, so getting a GST bill.As per the limitations :1. 60 Hz display (with the beautiful UI animations, it doesn't feel like one)2. Google exceeds on Maps, contacts and AI capabilities.3. Hefty price tag. (I mean! Wtf is this! 80k! Are you serious?)4. Necessity of a 1900 INR charger (That too of 20W and without extra cable. Why?)5. One sillicon case worth 4600 INR ( Sorry! My name's not Sanjib 'Ambani' ! Terrible joke! I know! I left my sarcasm capabilities at an Apple store for leverage.)Advantages:1. It's a flagship iPhone 12 with A14 bionic processor and it's best in the market.2. The UI and the optimization (And I came from an Android background.)3. Display (Can't find much difference if you're a Samsung flagship user.)4. The design and in-hand feel.5. The build quality, you can feel by holding it that it's premium.Overall, I found it very attractive and worthy of the money spent. (Because I am telling my mind this only as justification for a 80k expenditure)On a serious note, as coming from an Android background, if Samsung could launch a flagship with Snapdragon latest processor, I could think of buying that.But iPhone 12 in 2020? its a technological wonder. It's very slim, premium and beautiful.If you're comfortable to spend 80k, you should go for it for a wonderful experience."},

{"name": "Aashik Francis", "stars": "5", "title": "Confused? Read on! One stop review for your flagship purchase.", "review": "I went through a lot of reviews and articles before I decided on the iPhone 12. I\u2019ve been an Android user all my life and frankly thought Apple phones were really overpriced(at least here in India). But in the present day, the flagship Android options are no less expensive. If you spend a lot of time on your mobile, using it as your primary camera, social media device, business emails/collaboration and also to stream videos then you definitely need to spend a little more and go with a flagship option for the best experience.Coming to the flagships today (Aug2021), apart from the iPhone we have Samsung Galaxy S21/+/ultra, Oneplus 9 pro, Vivo x60 pro+, mi 11ultra. If you read a few reviews you\u2019ll understand that 888Snapdragon has a lot of heating issues and 9pro cameras didn\u2019t live up to the hype(also overheating when the camera is in use). Samsung in India ships the phone with exynos2100 which is way less powerful than 888. The prices of all these phones are in the same range (except the ultra). Imp note: iOS updates are across iPhone devices unlike the android updates.Apple has really done a lot of things right on the iPhone12:1. They changed its display from lcd to led (huge value jump)2. A14 Bionic chip is a really fast and smooth without any lag3. Huge improvement on the primary cameras. Still the best video recording phone in the market and the photos are top quality4. The change is the body design is really comfortable in the hand5. The haptics are spot onWhat\u2019s Missing: (Minor misses though)1. The Notch. Really wish they get rid of the notch but looks like it wont be out until 2023. Anyway you\u2019ll get used to it.2. USB type C charging. The iPad Pro 2020 model onwards already comes with the TypeC usb charging. I guess the iPhone 13 would get this change3. Fingerprint Sensor: Yes. Apple had done away with it couple of years back but with the pandemic still on, you sometimes wish there was a fingerprint sensorWait for the iPhone 13 or go with the 12:It took a while for 12\u2019s prices to fall. If you\u2019re willing to wait till Feb-March 2022 for a good deal then wait for the 13. If you want to change it now, go with the 12.64GB or 128GB:The difference is around \u20b96000. 64GB if you don\u2019t play too many games and keep dumping the media files every once in while to your pc/storage . Else, the 128\ud83d\ude0aBattery:I was indeed very surprised with the battery life. Charging time is a little slower compared to it\u2019s competition but the back up is impressive. It easily lasts a day.Android Flagship Option:The truth is, right now is not a good time to purchase an android flagship. If you really want to buy an android flagship, do wait for a while. 895 snapdragon phones are expected to be out by end of the year or early 2022.Hope this review helped :)Update:13 gets a better cam sensor, a15 bionic, 10% bigger battery and a slightly smaller notch. That\u2019s it. No more differences. Everything else remains the same.iPhone 13 launched at 80k which is lesser than 12\u2019s launch price(86k). If you want to save on some cash , 12 will still do the job (12 is currently around 55k-62k). However if you can spend that extra 20k, then 13 should be your pick.Planning on taking an Android? Definitely wait until early 2022."},

The software is butter smooth, i might never go back to android again. FIRST OF ALL - who said the battery life is bad? I got my phone at 70 percent charge at 2 pm and after 24 hours it was 20 percent EVEN AFTER I KEPT MY DATA PACK ON THE WHOLE TIME.SECONDLY- why are so many guys reviewing the phone on basis of the charger? everyone knows iphone 12 comes without an adapter. did you people not do your research before buying?THIRD - the 60 Hz thing does not matter at all, flipping screen is real quick u wont even notice the difference from a 120 Hz in androidand lastly - the AI is so sharp, be it the camera which automatically detects low light or even the face recognition.overall this phone is worth the high price. i will definitely be using it for 4-5 years. a happy customer here"},

Every new app installed needs permission to send notifications.And with a future update, facebook won't be able to track what you're doing in other apps outside of Facebook. This deserves an applaud. 2. BatteryThe battery is amazing, giving more than 6 hours of screen on time. OnePlus can't touch this. If you bring this up with them, they'll distract you by saying it has fast charging.3. Camera - photos are ok and decent BUT, DAMN, the video quality is amazing. Totally stabilized ready for uploads.4. Build Quality - SOLID.5. Continued updates for years and years. An android may last you 2-4 years, and the updated would be \"raam bharose\", but these new iphones especially will easily last 5 years minimum with no compromises on software and security upgrades.6. Less features, but they work 10/10. Example, auto fill OTP option in keyboard works every single timein iPhone. In Android, if your keyboard is open already before the otp arrives, then this feature won't work. Half baked implementation.Pro Android / Anti - iOS1. Notifications. Notifications centre on iPhone SUCKS. I have missed email notifications regularly. Android does this so well.2. Implementation of new app library feature sucks. This creates a very confusing situation. The way to solve this would be if the auto-folders in app library could be manually managed.3. Screen Sizes and Notch - The Notch is a disgrace for iphones when the iphones have reached the level of punch hole displays. Hoping the next year's model can make it better.4. No Truecaller in iPhone and no call recording. I can forgive the call recording considering the privacy first model, but truecaller is a pro to privacy.5. CHEAP QUALITY OF CHARGING CABLE. For a luxury brand, this is a disgrace.6. PRICE - Yes, iphones are expensive BUT, paying +10-15k for a phone available cheaper in Dubai / USA really pinches. Damn Taxes.7. Yes iPhones run smoothly but don't think that these don't stutter. I face very light stutters now and then and I restart at least once a week whenever I encounter it.I'll probably give this phone to my family member against their iPhone x since they're way too deep in ios ecosystem now."},

{"name": "Piyush Kumar", "stars": "3", "title": "Phone is great but iOS sucks", "review": "First of all, I don't know why people here are leaving misleading reviews, I didn't feel any sort of heating issue or something like that, neither my phone is damaged nor it is refurbished. These sort of reviews are only making other people sceptical.Now let's talk about the cell phone itself.It is great, I love it. The reason why I gave 3 stars is because I have been an android user before this device and I am being honest right now :-iOS sucks in terms of user experience, Android is easy to use and makes a lot of sense (believe me, I was a hardcore android user, I didn't only use it for playing games and making calls). In iOS I kinda feel like being constraint.let me give you few example, which are quite obvious but still not in iOS:-1. Notifications- You can't reply through notifications.- Notifications from a similar user/ sender do bundle, but you can only see the latest message (You can't just swipe down on notification to preview the messages)- if you want to remove a particular notification then you have to swipe two times to the left. If you swiped right then it will open the message for you (lol).- Notifications are so huge, sometimes it's really painful to scroll through all the notifications.2. App library- It has something called app library, they thought it'd be cool to make one but by giving their own flavor. They bundled things in their respective folder not like in android where each icon represent an app. You have to explicitly click on search(app library) to see all apps in the list view or to search an app. Just copy android, no one is slapping you in the face for that.3. whatsapp- Using whatsapp is really frustating sometimes.- To send some media to a contact, there are three processes. Two times it will do preparing and then one time it will do the sending (finally). if you are sending some big media to someone then you can literally get a 15 min power nap and then grab a cup of coffee and drink it, still there might be chances that the iOS would be in one of the preparing process.- Sometimes when you click on someone's profile then instead of opening the user's profile, whatsapp tends to scroll to the location from where that current day chats are starting (I think that is whatsapp's issue not iOS)- You can't directly send any media as a document (preserving it's quality). There are steps to do that too.The above points are few examples, I will keep updating them as per my experience.I am not saying iOS is slow or the phone's hardware is bad, it's actually quite opposite of bad, it's fast and amazing.I just hated the user experience domain of iOS. It really really sucks. iOS should bluntly copy the android things so that the HARDCORE IPHONE USERS will know what user experience they were missing."},

Do check the YouTube video to make necessary changes in settings for battery optimisation. Nothing beats the camera performance and let alone the video performance. Phone factor (rectangular edges) feels good to hold however even the MagSafe back cover when put on ruins the fun. Instead try buying a thin screen guard for back of the phone and tempered glass for the front glass as both front and back of the phone seem to be delicate and a costly affair when planning repairs. Overall the performance is great. The backup for Mini is pathetic, buy only if you have very minimal use of the phone. If a telephoto photography doesn\u2019t seem to be on your agenda then this is a smart choice over the pro model."},

We are unable to provide internal information about the reason for exchanges being denied. Unquote:Now that's a complete surprise to a customer...

{"name": "Ranit Kumar Dholey", "stars": "5", "title": "Long Term Review: Excellent All Rounder Device", "review": "This is going to be a long review, sit back, relax and have a read.I bought the iPhone 12 in May of 2021 after selling my OnePlus.Having used the iPhone7 and XR for years, this was my third iPhone.I have to say the iOS experience on the XR was absolutely horrible. Terrible reception, average battery and mediocre cameras forced me to move to android. I was tempted to move the 12 for all the improvements in modems, screen and the camera.And boy was I surprised . Let\u2019s take up the review in sections.1. Screen: Having used a high refresh rate screen of OP8 before, I was quite sceptical about the 60hz of iPhone12 before I bought it. But, astonishingly, the iPhone12 screen is buttery smooth, courtesy of the high touch sampling rate and excellent animations. This does not feel like a 60hz display, and I cannot stress this enough. The display is EXCELLENT .2. Camera: being a photographer who has spent half of his life travelling, I prioritise a good camera over anything else. And these are surely the most spectacular cameras that I have used on a smartphone. Excellent HDR, great details and very post processing friendly. Of course, the video is as good as it gets on a phone. Attaching some images I shot on the 12 for your reference. Trust me when I say this, you could use this for some semi professional shoot just fine, if it\u2019s only for social media and you are not printing really big.3. Battery: Battery on this device is not spectacular, it\u2019s average. It will get you through the day for sure, unless you are in very long video calls two three times a day. It is good enough, on par with my OnePlus.4. Build Quality: this is where it is head and shoulders above the competition. Rock solid, an led weirdly lightweight, this feels very, very premium.5. Software: iOS 14 and the iOS15 have really pushed the sub par experience of ios11 away, and this software now feels smoother than ever. Great improvements. Excellent software experience, not something I could say with my XR.Summary: Excellent device, with no complains. This could really be one of the first devices that I used which I can call perfect. Highly recommended."},

Though I was a fan of the iPhone 5 and 5s box design but couldn't buy them somehow. I wasn't and I'm not crazy about changing or upgrading phone every year so in 2015 I bought again iPhone 6s by having a thought that this phone has everything which I needed ever, except for box design. Now I was satisfied enough with this.As time goes on and years passed away many iPhone models came but I wasn't eager to buy any of them but when this year series 12 launched, that made me excited to buy because firstly I was technologically behind and secondly the nostalgic box design.Years ago, when I switched to iOS, I'm quite satisfied with it, I never thought and want to go back to Android.When it comes to iPhone 12, it's a great and beautiful device. Smooth performance, good battery life, overpriced of course but people always have the choice to buy it or not. Though face ID is new to me and initially little inconvenient compared to touch ID, hopefully, I'm gonna used to of it.I bought a 128 GB device as per my requirement and colour white because finger prints on back are not visible, compared to other darker colours.INR 3000\u20b9 Discount on the colour white, plus 6000\u20b9 HDFC instant discount.

But there's no substance to such things. I confirmed the warranty & product registration from Apple, it's as advertised.Since most of us are going to use it for a longer period of time, it's prudent to opt for the extended warranty offered by Apple which costs around 16500 which gives us an extended year of warranty.

I was using the Xr and 11 before this and though of upgrading.1. If you are moving from an android to iPhone for the 1st time, its a great phone to get in terms of camera, processor, screen quality. But if you are already an existing iPhone user, upgrade only from XR downwards. That is if your are upgrading from a 8/X/XS/XR. If you have a 11, stick to it. Wait for the 13 or budget is not a constraint then get the 12 pro.2. form factor. Apple has gone back to rectangle brick design that they used in their earlier phones. Now for me this was one the reasons I didn't like the phone. It wasn't comfortable n the hand after being used to the curve of the X and 11 and XR3. Camera- best camera quality with night mode . u can't go wrong with this camera setup.4. screen- excellent screen quality , no complaints here.5. 5g - IS it really that big a deal breaker ? especially if you are in India where 5g seems a long way off.6. No charging adapter. You either have to connect it to your MacBook or buy a separate power adapter. When ur spending 70 odd grand, that's the least apple could offer.7. again no ear phones.8.

There is a lot available on internet to tell you about what you will lose out on. It is like speaking a new language altogether.Quick image editing, video editing, simple things like making collages, setting custom ringtones, quick editing of alarms, changing WiFi or Bluetooth, toggling location, many more basic features are either absent in iOS or managed in a very cumbersome way. You will miss them if moving from Andriod. Also be ready to lose your WhatsApp chat history. Not impressed by the sound reproduction on bigger speakers via Bluetooth and the very inflexible equilizer.For some silly reasons Apple is being stubborn on some aspects like standardisation of charging cable even within its own products. The notch at the top of the screen is still the same size it was in 2018.Rest, there are tons of reviews to praise the phone and I agree with most of them.Was a bit disappointed the way it was packaged. No foam or bubble wrap."},

So, In 15 mins, you are having half the battery up. Love the border outlay of this beauty. It\u2019s almost a month of usage and I can boldly say, \u201cThe best switch one can make\u201d. I know the price tag is always hefty but then you are choosing a long term reliability. Kudos to Apple Inc and Amazon for amazing delivery in 2 days.*Please avoid playing Apple Arcade games as they would drain you battery like anything. In my best guess, It is not rightly optimised for it.*What I come to see is why Apple looked for environmental protection by removing charger and earphones. I guess it should come at a reasonable price then. It really put me off but then you know what the market player is serving."},

{"name": "Saurabh D.", "stars": "1", "title": "Service Woes....Defective product combined with Poor Service...read on......", "review": "Given a 1 Star as Apple continues to sell a defective product without resolving reported issues worldwideBeware: Buy at your own LUCK. This is solely based on my 2 months of experience with a defective iPhone12 128GB purchased from Amazon.Part I - The Rise of 'iPhone'The Saga began with an aspiration to buy a quality iPhone, feedback was that it never hangs....but wait no one told me that it won't hang till it works . This came as a gift to me from my wife, seeing my aspiration, she also got inspired and jumped the Gun to buy it on my birthday......But none of us imagined the nightmare it will become if you got yourself a defective piece. Don't believe me, search for \"iPhone 12 non-responsive screen\". You will get heartburns reading how many of them have non-responsive screens and have not worked even after replacement of whole phone itself, one guy had it replaced 3 times but issue kept coming back.It seems iPhone 12 is a defective buildAfter approx 15-20 days I started seeing same issue of phone unlocking(face unlock) but then nothing used to work on the touch screen. You are effectively not able to walk past the unlocked screen.If you locked and unlocked again, touch screen would start functioning till the next time it would behave in the same manner. I installed the apple support app to diagnose the issue and luckily the touchscreen issues went away without any trace.But wait, I wasnt so lucky, the same issue crept back exactly on the 54th day but this time with a vengeance, the phone simply wouldn't unlock no matter what you do. You can see the screen, it would charge and reboot and all that . Now began the nightmare which is the Part II.Part II - The Phantom(iPhone service) menace- No direct way to contact India customer support, only through chat and they will do an automated call back- First they tell me the usual workarounds, press button A, B, C etc etc. which I have already tried, standard procedures eating up so much time- Next after frustrating 30 min call with them, they send me instructions over email to take backup and do a factory restore(ignoring the fact that the touch screen isnt working)- As expected cannot take backup using itunes due to the PIN which requires your touch screen to work, frustrations are on the peak.- Now I reach back to support and they are trying to get me an appointment with the nearest service center, their service locator app is not working and I am scheduled a call back.- I wait at the designated schedule but I get a mail that I am not reachable, wait....my number is pre-fixed with a +91 and the automated call back is also adding another +91......shikes I will never get a call back.- Now I try to reach out to them, with the frustrations at the peak, didn't want to talk to them so started a chat session and luckily got the appointment with them in the next hour.- Reached the Service center, they asked me to wait, diagnosed and found that the iphone screen is not responsive, have to seek guidance from Apple.- After a week of checking online status which didnt change, I called the service center and asked for status. I am told that they are waiting for parts from Apple. I told them I am not interested, either replace the whole handset or refund the money.-I am provided Apple support number to talk to, as it a decision that has to come from Apple.- I immediately call Apple support and have a long conversation of over 45 minutes in which they are defiant to replace the handset and insist that they provide quality repair in India which after repairs will be like new only.- I offer them this \"NEW\" repaired phone and to give me my money back. I also state that in the USA, they replace and in INDIA is a repair, to which I am given an answer that every region has a different policy.....how discriminatory.- The call ends after 45 minutes of strong discussions that I will evaluate the quality of repair and then only accept the phone back. But with still no change in status on their site, I am not sure if they even know what to do with these screen issues on iPhonePart III - The Empire Strikes Back- For many days apple service did not have a clue on whats happening except for waiting for Apple to respond- After multiple followups and posts on twitter, got some attention- Repaired phone(not acceptable) was returned after 13 days with chassis replaced- Poor service for one of \"the\" expensive phones on this planet, Apple has taken Indian customers for granted. I am sure they would have replaced the phone immediately in US.BAD overall experience, has spoiled the product ownership experience forever."},

{"name": "Sandy", "stars": "5", "title": "Beauty + Beast", "review": "I have been an Android power user for 12+ years having used over 6 high end devices. I have enjoyed using every android device and was super comfortable having full control over Android OS/ecosystem (highly customizable options).iPhone 12 or rather iOS is in entirety a different world altogether. Simple, elegant, amazingly powerful, rich features and fully secure. iPhone 12 is a stunning beauty with a beastly performance. Simply put - iPhone 12 is vivacious, curvaceous, elegant, attractive and just feels so good in the hands. It's design is impeccable and purple of all looks super stunning.Now for the specs:1) A14 Bionic Chip: First chip in the smartphone industry built on a 5-nanometer process for performance and efficiency improvements. The 6-core CPU and 4-core GPU in the A14 is 50 percent faster than the fastest competing smartphone chips. Also includes a 16-core Neural Engine that offers an 80 percent increase in performance for machine learning tasks2) Camera: 27 percent more light for better performance in low-light conditions along with 2x optical zoom and 5x digital zoom. The photos are just brilliant, even in low light conditions. This iPhone can capture 30fps HDR video with Dolby Vision, enabling cinema-grade videos. For video fanatics this iPhone offers 4K HDR video recording3) Display: 6.1-inch Super Retina XDR OLED display / 2532x1170 resolution. It's a treat to watch videos on this iPhone. It's lively & pixel perfect.4) Battery: Well, this one is a slight bummer. Yes, much depends on your daily usage but overall it's pretty good.5) Security/Privacy: iOS is a closed ecosystem which gives less control to developers. This is the single biggest edge iOS has. Their review systems for developer is a cut above the rest. Though iPhones are vulnerable to hackers/viruses the chances are minimal because of their exhaustive sec measures6) Design: I love the new design of the iPhone 12. In addition to being smaller and lighter, it has flat sides and a flat screen.The iPhone 13 still doesn't cut above iPhone 12 in many aspects. I believe iPhone 12 is still the best smartphone until the launch of iPhone 14 (with some real tangible features & not just settling for some minor tweaks). Though it's been a full 1 year since it's launch, iPhone 12 is very much worth buying."},

{"name": "Siva Kumar B", "stars": "5", "title": "IPhone 12 review-sindhuja Badigineni", "review": "The iPhone 12 is the fanciest smart phone in the market currently. The iPhone is assembled with great care and caution so as to successfully meet the evolving customer needs. In order to demonstrate Apple\u2019s commitment to meeting the needs of its consumers, this paper provides a product review of the IPhone 12.This phone costs \u20b972,999 but it is worth the price. First of all, the IPhone 12 has a beautiful design. Many customers are concerned about how their phone looks. Unlike other phones that do not address this need, IPhone has an aesthetic feel. The IPhone 12 is also lighter compared to many other phone models (McFedries 12). This means that the phone is easy to carry both in the pocket and by hand. The weight of the phone matters because in many cases, heavier phones face the risk of dropping to the floor in case one is multitasking while handling the phone. In addition, it is sometimes uncomfortable to carry a heavy phone in the pocket because it often wears off due to the heavy weight. In addition to the light weight that characterizes the iPhone 12, it is important to understand that the phone has a higher speed in terms of internet connection and detection compared to other phones and the IPhone 11 model. This means that consumers will be able to enjoy the fast internet as they surf the internet. Considering the growing need for accessing the internet in daily activities such as social media, iPhone 12 is an ideal phone to possess. In addition to faster internet and Wi-Fi the iPhone 12 has a great GPS and location service (Cohen 31).This means that there is no need for purchasing a GPS if one possesses an iPhone 12. This shows that the iPhone12 is cost effective because one can save money for gadgets such as a GPS because the iPhone12 provides the same service. In addition to the GPS, the iPhone 12 can store large quantities of data, especially music. With an iPhone 12 one does not have to purchase an iPod for the purposes of listening to music. One can either save music directly on the iPhone12 or use a memory card to save music. In addition to music, the iPhone 12 has an excellent camera. The neatness of the pictures taken using the iPhone 12 is greater than other phones such as Android models and the iPhone 11. It is also important to note that the iPhone 12 provides a wide range of photo editing software compared to other phones in the market. Therefore, in addition to saving money that would be used to buy a GPS, one can also save money that could be used to buy a camera. The iPhone 12 also comes with excellent ringtones that can be assigned to each caller in the phone contacts. This is a characteristic that is not available in many phone models and those phones that have the service do not have nice ringtones. In addition to the software component of the iPhone 12, it is important to note that this phone's battery is long-lasting (Kelby & White 29). This means that the iPhone 12 can be able to stay charged for a longer time compared to many other phone models. For example, Android phones are known to drain their charge in a short period. Therefore, if one is looking for a phone that has a long battery life, the iPhone 12 is the ideal phone to purchase"},

I have started my android journey with Samsung galaxy S1 and after that HTC, ASUS, LG, many MI (including Mi3, first Xiaomi product in India) and since last 3 years 3 galaxy Latest series. To me camera is the most important feature for a mobile after making and taking calls. I was keen to buy S21 but felt apart from ultra other two are nothing special even not so premium like earlier galaxy series. By this time I broke my S20 plus and thinking for one plus 9pro but was not very happy with camera output, even lots of people are complaining about 888 chipset, and then I had only one choice it\u2019s iPhone, I was very much in dilemma as it\u2019s totally different OS with many restrictions. But somehow because of the camera I thought to give it a try, and man after 1 month I feel this is the best phone in the market. Other manufacturers must learn what\u2019s called optimisation, that tinny battery can last for almost complete one working day, google apps work better than android, games work flawlessly . And safety and privacy is in different league, I can choose whether I\u2019ll allow the app to track my use or not, Xiaomi are you listening??? And camera is surely best if you want to exact colour and white balance. Only disappointments are , WhatsApp chat can\u2019t be transfer from android, Truecaller doesn\u2019t work properly, and the Ugly big notch, common apple we know you brought this screen to body ratio concept but this notch needs to be removed."},

So the total costed around seventy six k which is double of my previous phone (OnePlus 5t)It's still one heck of a Phone. Putting down few reasons on why to go for it:1) True Flagship - if you are planning to buy a phone above fifty k, android won't give you that experience, as even a thirty k android gives more or less similar performance to a flagship android2) Cameras - It has the best camera, totally worth it3) Privacy - if you don't want personalised ads to pop based on what you speak, browse or show interest for, then go for it.4) Build quality - The phone looks very strong and compact.
