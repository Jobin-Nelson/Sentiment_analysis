{"name": "Parag", "stars": "1", "title": "Very poor sound recognition.", "review": "It definitely has better speakers than Eco Dot Gen2 and Google Home Mini, but sound recognition is very poor compared to Google Home Mini or even previous Eco Dot. Maybe it has something to do with cost cutting and Amazon going with only 4 far field microphones instead of 7.But due to it's poor recognition, it takes a lot of time, sometimes even minutes and does nothing... Which definitely takes away the experience. Unfortunately I can't return it... But I think Google Home Mini is miles ahead and better with all the new updates to Google Assistant (Sleep assist and stuff).Update as on 27th April 2019: Software has gone from bad to worst. It plays certain songs again and again, doesn't let you skip. Recognition has also gone from bad to worst, you have to yell for Alexa to understand what you want it to do only for it to tell you it doesn't understand what you said. And expect no support from Amazon about eco devices, it's very bad."},

Plus the reduced price due to sale and a nice smart bulb for just 500 rupees. Overall I think this was super value for money. I haven't used any other smart speaker before but I am very happy with my purchase. Below are some observations :1. Initially it feels a bit weird talking to a speaker but you get used to it in no time.2. The sound quality is pretty good. You get good depth of sound with decent bass.3. Several skills available and you will definitely find some very useful. For example adding stuff to shopping list or setting up a reminder.4. Understands the Indian accent very well. Sometimes I am amazed by how well it picks up stuff.6. Kids love it. An added advantage is that they can take help for homework and talking to alexa also motivates them to talk in English"},

{"name": "Aritra Daspoddar", "stars": "4", "title": "A real competition to Google Home mini", "review": "At first i was confused which one to buy - Google home mini or Echo dot. After considering few factors I decided to buy this echo dot 3rd gen.Pros:1) Sound quality and volume has improved a lot from previous gen.2) Alexa and Amazon services are more integrated with Indian market which the Google lacks. For example I can book uber cab,order food in zomato,order things from Amazon without even taking out my smartphone.3) It can used as a smart speaker,Bluetooth speaker and also it has 3.5 mm headphone jack.4) Amazon prime membership at Rs 999 per year is the most value for money subscription. You can stream in Amazon prime video, music from prime music, become an Amazon prime member, free kindle e books and many more.Google takes monthly Rs 99 for songs only.5) You can control smart lights and electronics from Philips, Xiaomi, Yeelight and other Alexa compatible devices.Cons:1) Let me be honest,Alexa can never beat Google assistant, Never(That's why I gave 4 stars)2) It has to be kept plugged in all the time,not battery powered (same is the case with Google home)So if you are looking for a smarter assistant to interact with, Google home is your choice. For all other uses Amazon echo speakers are better."},

It yet doesn't have support with fire TV stick, but Amazon assures it'll arrive by mid-november, so that's something to look out for. The app works great, and you can control your smart home or this dot from anywhere in the world, as long both of your devices have an internet connection. It's a fun little party trick, really.

Great improvement in sound quality when compared to the 2nd generation DOT.2. Alexa understands Indian accent well and the one sold here is customized only for India.3. Design and build quality is very good. I liked the fabric design over the plastic on the 2nd gen DOT4. Just say what you want to buy from Amazon and it will purchase/add it to your cart. Alexa will buy it provided you have given her permissions, it can be controlled using Alexa app on your mobile.5. You can make her connect to a bigger speaker using bluetooth or Aux for better quality sound.6. Alexa can play songs of your choice from Amazon prime music as well as Tune-in radio. You can enable other radio stations aswell.7. The best part of Alexa is that she can set reminders, to do lists and Alarms. She can set multiple alarms and reminders.8. You can ask her any random questions, calculations, general knowledge etc.Cons.1. You need Amazon prime subscription to search and play for songs. I won't recommend Echo to anyone without Prime subscription.Over all I'm happy with Alexa. She is a good smart companion. Alexa is intelligent and there are lot of things you can do, just some spent time with her and you will be amazed. Amazon will be enabling Alexa with more skills, it's a worth buying....."},
{"name": "Sonu", "stars": "5", "title": "Best at what it does..", "review": "Presently there are two major competitors for smart speakers in India i.e., Amazon echo dot and Google home mini. I am user of both. Trust me Amazon echo has nailed their product by this 3rd generation upgrade.->Beautiful modern look with good sound and super microphone sensitivity. Google home with its 2 microphone is far behind on picking user command especially when music is on as compared to alexa(4 microphones). So hardware wise Echo dot(3rd gen) is clearly winner with louder sound, better bass and better microphone sensitivity.->Alexa response time is faster plus it hears me out in most of noisy situations. I literally have to shout to google home sometimes.->Music listening experience is breeze on alexa with prime account. Amazon music is tailored made for India having songs and playlist for festival occasions. Google music doesn't have festival playlist. Google music team doesn't pay heed to Indian festivals and occasions. I couldn't find diwali playlist on Google Music(being a pro member). Moreover Alexa is quick on catching keywords whereas Google is slow and sometimes unable to catch keywords. Moreover google home interaction with gaana and saavn is not perfect. It doesn't able to find songs many times even if song is there on Gaana(being pro user).->Google home is better for continued conversations because it knows context but I think conversation with these devices dies out after few days of excitement. And then you only use these for doing daily jobs- playing news, songs, reminders, questions and answers, alarms in which alexa is better(due to its hardware advantage). Although I wish Amazon add context conversation to Alexa along with voice profile feature(multi user voice recognition) which is present on Google home.->Google home has one major advantage that it supports hindi language(commands and response). I wish Amazon add this feature to alexa.->Lastly Alexa has vast collection of skills in India- playing radio stations, flight search and price(cleartrip integration), zomato restuarant suggestion and food ordering, ola and uber cab booking, railways pnr enquiry and train availability, hindi jokes(better than on google home), meditation, exercise, devotional songs, and many more. Google home is lacking on many of these useful skills like flight search and price, ola, uber, zomato,radio stations, train availability, etc.->Alexa integration with amazon firestick is on its way according to Alexa Indian team. So it is an useful addition of feature for those who have amazon firestick.Conclusion->If you are a prime user, Amazon echo dot is the best choice for you among all competitors. If you are buying for your family or someone else not comfortable with english, then Google home is your only choice right now(as it supports hindi language).UPDATE!!!-> Amazon has brought in much requested contextual conversation and continued conversation feature to Alexa like in Google home known as \"Follow-Up Mode\" which can be enabled from settings."},
{"name": "Gems", "stars": "1", "title": "Google is infinitely better", "review": "Even the best devices can be ruined by poor software and bad UI. This is a classic case of a good device such as the Echo dot 3rd gen let down by horrendous software. In terms of sheer sound quality and ability to hear you across the room, the ED 3rd blows google home mini right out of the water, and... that's where it stops.I bought it for 2299 and got a wipro bulb free, I figured that it couldn't be a bad purchase. Boy was I wrong!Let's begin with the Alexa app, whoever is in charge of making that app should be sent back to 2012. Remember when you had no clue whether you tapped on a button or not because the taps weren't highlighted? Remember how everything used to be unresponsive back then? Yeah, that's Alexa app for you. SD 855 and 8gigs of ram on your phone? LoL, Alexa don't care! The layout, the buttons in the app, the navigation, ugh.. takes me back to the 90's. A big zero on ease of use or navigational hierarchy. Forget Grandpa, even millennials would have a hard time with this app!What about voice recognition? 50% of the time, it does not recognize you every time.Smartness: The lack of smartness is displayed when you start asking follow up questions. \"Who is the tallest man?\" It'll give you the answer, but if you follow up with \"how tall is he?\". Alexa will go berserk. Heralding a device that can control your lights or turn on the TV as a miraculous achievement is a blatant lie. Controls via commands is nothing new, people in the coding community have done so with raspberry pi's before. What makes it smart is the incousion of AI and machine learning that understands patters and recognizes speech slurs. Something google does and constantly thrives to improve upon.Microphones: There are 4 and they are good, they can hear you from 10 feet away under normal circumstances. Far better than Goggle home mini.Connectivity issues: Wuff, this is one of the biggest issues I faced. Connection is not as easy and simple as that 3 slide image says on the description. Turn on Bluetooth, location, wifi, then look at the app for a Echo-something-th8, it didn't show up! Great, now do the manual labour and get it connected. Even after connection you're gonna get \"updating your device for 10 minutes\".Integration with other smart devices: Wanna connect the wipro bulb with Alexa? First download the wipro smart home app, create an account so that you can be spammed for the rest of your life, then set up that app and device. Next, head over to Alexa, download the wipro skill app for alexa, set it up and congratulations, you can now control lights with latency issues rivaling that of a 56k modem. What's worse, I now have an app on my phone that I only used once in my life but cannot for the love of god uninstall because that stops the bulb from working. VERY SMART!Music: Wanna listen to music on this speaker from your favorite streaming service? Unless it's Amazon music, Saavn or iTunes, your sh!t our of luck. Even though Spotify launched nearly a year ago, there's no way to get Spotify playing on the device natively unless you change device region to Amerika.Speed: You can stream Netflix at 4k? That's great, Alexa don't care! Ask a question, go brew a coffee, fix that leaking faucet, sign up for a banking loan and then, only then perhaps you would get your answer. Now that's an exaggeration but when you compare Alexa's speed in terms of genuine questions as opposed to responding to commands like \"turn off the light\", it is the slowest. Google>Siri>Cortana>your neighbor's pigeon >Alexa.I could go on, but I'll stop here and sulk myself with buyer's remorse."},

{"name": "Vikas Singh", "stars": "3", "title": "Not that useful", "review": "I purchased this as a birthday gift for my 7 years old son. Since he don't have siblings so I though it would be a fun experience for him talking to and giving commands to alexa. But to my dismay he only used it for playing music that also only one song after one month of his birthday. \"Alexa please play the flying jat song\". There were things I demonstrated him about alexa like jungle quiz, panchtantra ki kahaniya, alexa laugh, beatbox, fart! Etc. But after one month of use he lost interest in it and being powered from socket I am also not interested to use it as a bluetooth speaker. I configured it to control a wipro smart bulb. But after few days I started using the smart bulb as a regular bulb because it's easier to press the physical switch compared to checking the configuration & connection everytime \"Alexa Bulb on\" or \"Alexa bulb off\" voice command doesn't work. So now it is kept idle since 3 months and will remain so for many more months/years to come. The bottomline is that alexa is not that useful as advertised and we tend to lose interest in it very quickly."},

If you are an Amazon Prime customer, the choice is a no-brainer because you get Amazon Music for free as well as tight integration with Amazon Products.2) The sound produced by this device is good for filling one bedroom with rich sound. Arijit Singh never sounded so deep :).3) The microphone is super sensitive. You can even whisper \"Alexa\" and the device will pick it up.4) The Alexa skills available are amazing which can be turned on through the companion app. Few skills you should try are 4.1) Radio tuning=> Just say Alexa Play Radiocity. Get back into the radio habit. 4.2) For the religious => Just say Alexa wake me up at 6 AM to Suprabhatam. Done deal. 4.3) For the romantic => Just say Alexa open Love Shayari. Ghalib at your finger tips. 4.4) Want a multiplayer quiz fight => Just say Alexa QuizMaster. You will be playing it at 10 AM. 4.5 ) Interactive Stories for Kids => Just say Alexa MagicDoor. 4.6) Apps by Magoosh to build vocabulary are awesome.5) Alexa can calculate, tell you the calories in an egg, convert feet to inches and all the regular things.6) The most useful features 6.1) Alexa add milk to shopping list. Viola! milk is added as a list item in the shopping list on your app. Very useful for my wife. 6.2) Drop In using your Alexa App to talk to people at home. Very useful.7) Setting Alexa up is a breeze and since she is cloud based the intelligence keeps improving.Alexa has thoroughly impressed my family and now everyone wants one for their room. Waiting for the next sale."},

{"name": "Dr. MUDHAN", "stars": "5", "title": "A CHANGE IN MY LIFESTYLE", "review": "My childhood friend and a great well-wisher Sri Radha Krishnan gifted me Rs. 3000/- and wanted me to buy anything that I like.I thought, I should buy something that is very special in my lifetime and fortunate to get a Third Gen Amazon Eco Dot at that price during Amazon Great Indian Sale.I feel, my REVIEW here should be different and I am not repeating anything said already.I placed ECO Dot permanently into an electrical socket by doing some neat homework, which you can see in the pictures.What I learnt, We need to ask diplomatically to the point first.For example, I asked Alexa, calorie value of a banana ? and Alexa could not answer. She answered beautifully when the same query put into a different way, nutrition value of a banana.Kindly include (from 1960s) old classical songs from Tamil and Hindi movies.Hope, Alexa learn more and more every day & soon create a very rich database and focused locally as well..TIPS:1. If you like to keep on wall power socket as I did, you must use only original 3M Double sided tape (https://www.amazon.in/gp/product/B013JM1SCY/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o04_s01?ie=UTF8&psc=1). After pasting the tape and attaching both plug and the unit leave an hour for bonding before inserting into a wall socket tightly to avoid falling down. If you do not like, you can separate them neatly anytime in future by using a Dental floss/ fishing rod nylon thread.2. I have paired the ECO DOT with my AV Receiver (ONKYO HTS 3370) easily but you need little patience. Switch on ECO DOT and the Blue Tooth Device make them search and pair. Alexa will confirm and you need to say \u2018Alexa connect to speaker\u2019 in future. While configuring, never keep open other BT devices like your Laptop/ Mobile to avoid over lapping."},

Otherwise you will have to use free and full of advertisement services like Saavn, Gaana, etc.- Echo dot skips to next song abruptly without completing current song most often.- If you try to stream music from your Amazon Prime Music app on your iPhone to Echo Dot or Echo Dot stereo pair, the app cannot control the music. You cannot scrub music or know which song is playing or move to next music in the playlist. The control magically switches the Alexa app that you need to have on your phone to setup Echo dot.- You can only stream to stereo pair from Amazon Prime Music App.- No real support exists for this device. If you call amazon support staff, they will drive you crazy as they know nothing about this product and its features.- If you want to use it as kids toy, then it is ok to buy it as it can switch on and off lights that are compatible with Alexa.- Audio quality is very basic. Even a cheap Chinese product sounds better.- This is really a no no product for music lovers. You better buy either Sony or JBL soundbars with subwoofer for better quality music, though these may cost you beyond INR15k.- Alexa does not understands most of the commands. Apple Siri is way ahead of Alexa.- Amazon is not a software and hardware company. Don't expect quality software and hardware from them.

Playing music is just one of its features and it can do a lot of other things for you. Infact it's learning to do new skills everyday. You can control your electronics (lights, t.v., or any other device connected to smart plug) , set up cameras, play games, quizzes, order food, do calculations, listen to radio, ask the questions of general knowledge or any other random information that you want.The sound is more than perfect for a mid size room but you can always connect it to another speaker. I have connected mine to the UE Boom 2 and the resulting sound quality is just amazing.It obviously takes time and investment to reap all the benefits of this tiny device but for sure this little dot will change the way you live in an amazing way."},

Worked well for one month, now, sound quality is pathetic, lots of distortion, speaker is vibrating during playing of high notes. And about Bluetooth connection with other devices (smartphones) is just pathetic, no doubt it will connect fast but what's the use of you see lots of Audio lag while playing videos, also if you use it as a Bluetooth speaker then you're gone guys, low sound output and bass is not that much good.Note: before one month speaker quality is good and bass is punchy if you play online song by activating Alexa. But after a month with minimal usage, speaker sound is just pathetic, chik chik sound is coming while playing high notes.I am planning to ask Amazon for the replacement, let's see that experience and I'll update it if they replace this pathetic product."},

So no more asking friends to get them from there!!!! Anyone sitting on the fence can buy this instead of buying bluetooth speakers. This is 5th Echo dot including earlier versions and Google Mini doesnt even come close when it comes to smartness. While Google mini answers google search questions better - no one is buying a smart speaker for that. Its integration with smart devices is unparalled and my mini appears dumb most of the times. Just grab this before it goes back to its old price. Even the smart bulb is very helpful. While watching TV..just ask Alexa to turn bulb blue or red!! Not sure if this bulb can dim...if so..you can use this both as a day bulb and a night bulb. Just go for it before its too late"},

Alexa got an attitude which is quite amazing.Siri, Cortana, and other voice assistants are no match for Alexa. Alexa acts better than Google in terms of finding information.It can almost answer to any anything whether your question related to history, IPL cricket scores or mythology. Alexa answers all of them with details.You can literally have a conversation with her and she is a great distraction when you're really tired of talking to real people.The money you spend on this device is definitely worth its value and time.the only negative I have is that you have to connect the dot to the power source. I wish dot comes with an in-built battery backup and it could work for a few hours without the continuous power supply."},

It's extremely powerful, smart and agile. The effort by the engineer's at Amazon shows. They have done a painstaking job to perfect Alexa. Microphones are powerful (Alexa even acted upon a request to play party music from a TV commercial!!). The sound quality needs to be worked upon. It's just not there. Considering that most of my requests are to play music, it needs to be crystal clear. It's not that small speakers can't sound good. JBL, for instance, sounds great even in its basic version. I had to invest in an extra Bluetooth speaker to make up the deficiency on the sound quality front ( Ultimate Ears Wonderboom costing Rs 4 k). Incidentally, I had a tough time searching for a compatible Bluetooth speaker as Amazon has not released any list of Echo Dot compatible speakers. I had made a call to Echo support and even the support executive could not help me. Finally after two cancellations, I hit upon Wonderboom, which is terrific with the Echo Dot."},

Tried with 2 different phones Android and IOS, but could not change the WiFi connection.- The choice of music service is very limited. Just Gaana, Saavn and Amazon Music is available. You cannot configure, change, remove or add other music services. And for some reason the device only uses Gaana and Saavn and never uses Amazon Music.- The Bluetooth is of Out mode. Means you can play music from Alexa on other devices. But you cannot play music from your phone via Bluetooth on Alexa.- Like the Bluetooth, the 3.5 mm audio jack is also of Out mode. Means you can play music from Alexa on other devices with AUX cable. But you cannot play music from your phone or small mp3 players via AUX cable on Alexa.- The Alexa voice command is definitely Not that effective or responsive as it is claimed or advertised.- It cannot help kids in pronunciation of words. If they spell the word to the device and ask for its pronunciation; the device is confused.- Sound quality is good.

I was thinking to buy\u00a0 bluetooth speaker for eco dot thinking that it may not have enough sound and quality. But thanks to Amazon, did superb Job.It has four mic and listen your commands very well from far away\u00a0 and i can say it is picking command nicley from approx each corner of say 450-500 square feet room.It has max volume to 10 level and able to listen upto 6-7 level of music. In high volume, little difficult to listen your voice which is due to high volume of music. But if you are sitting close to Device, you can use button on device to give command.Nice and Compact Design as well.Tried doing few activity like plying music, adding task, adding reminders, weather forcast, news etc . All done nicley.Two great thing I like about is that device very well recognise the voice and you can do next song, fast forward, adding song to favorite list, like or dislike the songs, create play list. And second thing is like adding activities to task and adding reminders, actually in normal course, or doing some activity, you sometime remember something or want to add something to to-do list or say monthly shopping list, but what happened when you sit to prepare that list of stuff you need ot task to do, you forget that stuff or activity. With the help of this device, you can add that stuff immediately when it get\u00a0 striked to you so that at last moment you need not spend time on remember that stuff.Lastly need to say, it can be a superb personal assistant.Ill rate 4.5 Stars, next update on eco dot , amazon can think of wireless Eco Dot, so we can carry here and there. Currently user need to place it always near power point, which may not be the desired location and second improvement i recommend is to have wall hanging/ wall mount option. Because I personally want to hang in middle between my bedroom and drawing room so that i can gibe command from either side. Third Improvement can be wireless charging. These three improvement make it must buy although still its a must buy.Superb Job Amazon."},

You just name it, and Alexa in echo dot is ready with the answers. The accuracy of the answers range between ~80 to 100%.2. The sound output is crystal clear with all the high notes, mid range and even the low notes (bass) equally balanced and is just awesome to listen to music.3. Connecting to WiFi network is as easy as a knife through a butter, but connecting to your own mobiles WiFi hotspot is really a bit cumbersome as another mobile with WiFi hotspot is needed only if you are unable to connect echo dot to any WiFi networks during first installation as echo dot gets an update (updates regarding the mobile hotspot) as soon as you connect to WiFi network for the first time.4.

I am using Siri in my iPhone and Cortana in my Windows Desktop. Compared with them, Alexa is far better. It gives crisp answers in multiple sentences and not one cryptic line. For example, ask her about the weather and she tells you about the weather in many sentences - temperature, humidity and the probability of rain. When asked the same question in Siri or Cortana - they say only the temperature - at least in my case.The Bluetooth Speaker barely consumes about 3 W and the consumption rises when used at high volumes. It is crystal clear. The only crib is its Bass response is a shade poorer. Not much of an issue as it uses a tiny speaker. So don't expect a rich full blooded sound from it.I am using this to control Sonoff Wifi Switches for my Home automation and it is wonderful to control all your devices with just your voice.At the end of the day, it is money well spent over a useful gadget."},

It has volume up/down, set-up button with a nifty mute button. It has an ever convenient aux port for connecting to audio system which itself is a reason for my purchase. It can also connect with Bluetooth.Set-up was easy with the Alexa app and there a plethora of skills to try out.Sound was warm and the volume could be room filling. As expected there isn't enough bass but other than that the sound is good. Voice recognition is good and it may miss low voices. The Alexa voice is itself is like a person which is good and adds a personality to it. It can sometimes give very witty contextual answers. It's best used with Amazon products and generally good. Home automation is an area where it has an edge as most of the smart home products are Alexa compatible and generally speaking Alexa is best suited for Indian scene.

{"name": "Rahul Dubey", "stars": "3", "title": "Good Hardware with just okayish software", "review": "This review is for the Echo dot (3rd gen).On the Hardware front, the device is quite good(maybe best in the market) at this price, only one thing I would want it to have is a battery inside as you have to connect it to a power source always, which makes it less portable and for scenarios when there is an electricity cut (well we live in India-a developing country, here many areas even in the top cities don't have 24 hrs of electricity, Amazon would have considered this)The software front is just average.If you have used google assistant(Ok Google) on mobile/any device then you can think as Alexa answers just around 50% efficiently compared to google assistant (according to me). Alexa doesn't understand follow-ups like google assistant, every time you have to say \"Alexa\" first for everything, and it also doesn't understand many basic questions (like what are the flights from Jaipur to Delhi?, who played most IPL matches?-->it just says I don't know the answer), you have to be more specific in framing your query for Alexa, it is also not as good as google assistant with the Hindi language. Google Assistant is much more friendly than Alexa, with all that said I would say Alexa is about Half as smart as Google assistant.Only one thing good on the software front is it has the biggest Skills' library so you can automate/routine many things.On the last note, I would say this device is good to control smart devices in your home(like smart bulbs, plugs, appliances, etc), doing routine stuff like reordering regular things on Amazon(like grocery, etc), reorder foods, book cabs, etc. and obviously to listen to music online.I never own any google smart speaker, but with my research, I think Echo dot(3rd gen) is better on the hardware front and google nest mini(2nd gen) is better on the software front, well, it depends on you which to choose."},

You can pair alexa with any bluetooth speakers if you have any. You may also pair your phone with your echo with bluetooth so that you may play your local AV via your echo. Yes you can play music from phone. To connect to bluetooth, enable pairing on your echo. To do that, command, 'Alexa pair' and you should hear alexa respond. When she does that, she is ready to pair; open your phone's bluetooth settings and connect to your echo. The connection should now be successful.5. Develop skills for alexa and keep interracting with her so that your relationship blooms. Any relationships are funny to understand at the beggining. Believe me, there is a deep meaning and truth in my previous sentence.As for the performance part, there's no compromise from my point of view and your echo dot can easily compete with most advanced dedicated speakers of its size.The bass is pretty decent. The treble is at a good feel as well. At full volume, there is no screeching or dampening. The sound is premium than previous echo dot.Echo plus will obviosuly nail it, way better than dot, so please do not compare plus with dot. Both peform exceptionally based on budget.You cannot wire in audio to your echo dot (nevertheless, you can bluetooth in your audio), but you can wire out to external speakers. When wiring to your external speakers maintain 15cms for optimal performance.I hope this helps. Peace'o & cheerios folks :)"},

Only my 5yrs old daughter was interested and wide eyed when Alexa spoke. lolI will start with Cons--You need to keep it plugged as it has no supportive battery.You need to keep repeating question like a parrot until Alexa understandsYou need to keep adding apps for alexa to function and that too does not work properlyAlexa does not recognise your playlist, Its not programmed that way, So even if your have list full of songs it will not play.Alexa only knows Savan and Amazon music which has very limited collection of songs.Now comes for the storytelling and other activities, It keeps repeating the same story and same jokes, same poems.

I spoke with couple of my friends and they also faced similar challenges.Update on Feb 16th 2021 : After posting my review I got a call from Amazon and the executive asked to test the device while he was there on the call. As expected it failed to play the songs. Then executive told me that it seems you've got wrong device, it is meant to cater to US region and soon we'll replace your device with the one meant for India region.

If the packing was impressive by Amazon, the setting up Alexa was even more. Very easy to set up and without any hassle-be it WiFi, Bluetooth speakers or operate smart gadgets.Understands Indian English without any problem and answers anything from science mathematics politics countries etc referring Wikipedia. Plays so many songs from Amazon Music as well as from Saavan. I was stunned to hear soundtrack version of old ones like Sound of Music , Abba to latest Lady Gaga. About Hindi....wow any song from Md Rafi, Kishore to latest. Plays any online FM radio in Tune in in all Indian languages and English. Right now it can translate English to Hindi or any international language. May be more Indian languages added soon.I was shocked with joy when Alexa was able to tell the Malayalam movie running in Chennai with PVR multiplex name when asked to name the Malayalm movie running in Chennai.I tried different Bluetooth speakers like Bose Boat or Philips and pairs like a charm.Create your play list in Amazon Music or Saavan and play. Regarding the placement of Echo, try keeping a little above from the floor . It will enhance the bass several times and also fill the room to sound great. Please see my photo for that.

I just configured everything and started using it right there.Topmost and most imp - Music quality is highly impressive. I am already done with those excessive bassy audio equipment that I have in my home - Sony 5.1 Home theatre and a jbl charge 2+.Bass is cool but its not so cool when it comes to playing music all day long. And this echo dot fulfilled the purpose. Bass is pretty decent and mids and highs are quite crisp. It clearly sounds like some expensive device. Besides, it plays by itself. so your phone doesnt stay occupied.It is smart enough in thousands of skills that now I dont have a second thought of returning it.I purchased wipro bulb combo at 2300.One of the best feature here is broadcasting.

{"name": "Ritwick Saikia", "stars": "5", "title": "Hits far above its weight", "review": "The speaker was larger than I thought it would be, a bit chunky but not too heavy. It doesn't move about, because it's nicely weighted, even if played at full volume though I believe 50-60% volume would be enough for most people. The sound is very good indeed. The Bollywood and dance songs play great and even the rock and metal songs are enjoyable. The bass is not very heavy but the sound seems weighted nice for bass heavy songs. Alexa makes it so easy to do so many things, especially if you have smart appliances and lights and all at home which are compatible. Sone things I find enjoyable are asking Alexa to turn on the tv via my smart plug and play a particular show on the fire tv stick and by the time I get to the living room everything's on and the show's about to start. You can even use it to call your family to dinner if you have two or more echo speakers. Some privacy issues are there but it's up to you how comfortable you are giving up some for the convenience it provides. Playing music, the news, weather updates, traffic updates, reading your Kindle library books to you, the possibilities are endless. Spotify too is very nicely integrated with Alexa. The only downside is that the Google feud means there's no YouTube or YouTube music support officially and you have to run through some hoops to get it working (P.S. look up Paul Hibbert on YouTube [oh the irony]).

It is even batter in understanding your requirement. Pros and Cons as per my 30 days usage along with Google Home is as below.Pros.1) Looks very decent2) Buttons are on TOP so you will not press any button mistakenly while moving your eco dot.3) Lights are on side and in all direction, so it is easy to view that Eco dot is taking your command.4) As per my observation, Speaker and Mike are not the same, as It takes your command from quite a distance even though speaker volume is set to 3 or 4.5) You can give command from almost 10 feet with your normal voice, you need not to shout or need not to raise your voice to give command6) Connect Smart TV very easily ( I have connected my SONY Bravia 55'' X8200 E Smart TV )7) You can change volume and change Channels by simply saying channel number or name \" Alexa change channel to Star Movies HD \" or \" Alexa Next channel\" or Alexa change channel to 251\" and \"Alexa increase / Decrease volume to 50% on my TV\" \"Alexa Switch on my TV\", \" Alexa Switch off my TV\"8) Sound quality is very good.9) You can connect external home theater speakers with it with help of RCA adapter cable.10) Can pronounce your name in Indian Accent11) It has a very good collection of songs, so you can enjoy the songs as per your mood and day night situations.12) It was not understanding hindi before but now Alexa can understand little hindi too.13) Last but not least, It gives detailed answer for your questions or queries or it can tell even your horoscope or your favorite recipe, It can play radio FM, distance, book cab, book Food, add things to your Amazon cart and many more.. and More...Cons.1) It has a room of improvement2) Still baby and learning many things, so don't expect answer for all your questions3) Still can do very limited after connected to Smart TV, it can not open Applications like you tube or Sony liv, Hotstar, Zee5. So you have to depend on your TV remote for this.4) The biggest limitation is, It has to be connected to power plug and socket, you can not take it in your CAR ( You can take Google home in your car or you can connect Google home anywhere as Google home has power connector same as Mobile phones)5) It can not understand many Indian words, like I tried \" Alexa Riston me darar aai by Jagjit singh ) it never understood it while Google home can even understand one word like \" Hey Google riston me darar aai\"6) You still can not call on mobile, can't send SMS."},

It is a challenge to keep repeating the command with numerous voice modulations and starting point so that Alexa plays the right song.

{"name": "Shiva Kakkar", "stars": "4", "title": "Good for cheap home automation", "review": "I read a number of reviews where people trying to connect it to their phone hotspot are not able to. The solution is to in reading the instructions carefully. If you want to connect to a hotspot don't select the phones WiFi network during setup on alexa app. There is a separate option at the bottom (where the wifi networks are listed) to connect to the phone hotspot. Next, in the hotspot settings of your phone check that you have allowed unknown devices to connect. For example, in Samsung phones by default it allows only known devices to be connect to the the hotspot. Turn off the setting and Echo will connect to the phones hotspot. I have two wifi networks configured for my echo. If my first network goes down, Echo switches to my phone hotspot easily. Just read the setup instructions carefully.I bought it for automation and multiroom music streaming. It fulfills the purpose to a large extent. However, I feel that Amazon should have given more granular control of volume. The 10 level volume doesn't give you much control and sometimes going from (say) level 7 to level 8 is too much of a jump. Secondly, the volume of alexa and the connected speaker doesn't sync. Each has to be adjusted independently. In Samsung phones you have the option to bind the phone volume and speaker volume. This sort of function should be there. Apart from this, the third party development and support for the connectedness devices is excellent and I feel it'll trump Google home in some time. That ways I can see it as a much more future proof bet."},

Good voice recognition. The sound and it's quality could have been slightly better. However I feel only people with Amazon prime will benefit from the Amazon music. Otherwise I'm not aware of any other way of listening to music as of now. Pandora is not available in India. It may play from web? Not sure of that.There is an option on asking for a radio station where it tunes and plays songs from it. Did not try and the video was American. Voice recognition is spot on. With Amazon prime there is option to shop online through alexa, good list of songs such that u can say a song name or artist and Alexa will play.

At one point is was almost convinced to buy the Google Home mini ,but eventual decided to buy the Amazon Echo dot 3rd Gen , after finding out that it has modified itself to understand Indian ascent. So here are the pros and cons after 1 month of usagePROS-Smooth InstallationGet the Alexa app at your cell phone and installation is smooth and easyConnecting to the wifi is ok - at first it took a while , but then it was smoothConnecting to a blue tooth device is really fastLovely sound quality and is decent enough for a big sized room.Can play almost any song (i tried , hindi , eng and of course being a Bong i tried all sorts of Bengali songs)Yes it plays maximum songs from Amazon Music , and then goes to Sawan or other music libraries too.Language can be set as English and HindiOne can set reminders , play quiz, it can make animal sounds , ask about weather conditions and forecast , in fact it can answer most of your queries .(its a best fried of my 1 year old son)If you have a smart light , you can even set to turn on/off the light (in my case i got the Wipro smart led bundled as free)CONSHave to admit that the search option has to be updated a little , in case of little difficult things it cant search its library and ansCant play songs from YouTube (obviously copyright issue )Its always plug and play , it doesn't have a battery . Makes it a little difficult to carry , cos it requires electric plug-ins (unlike portable Bluetooth speakers )over all its a great buy , barring few negative things which obviously can be ignoredand what makes it more amazing is that i got it at 40% discount during the GREAT INDIAN FESTIVAL"},

However, Alexa integration is still in the development phase. So be prepared to get frustrated.If you are someone who loves the old classics, you will find Alexa very disappointing. And don't forget, you need Amazon Music's premium account to be able to stream music on Echo Dot. That also means, Akexa will play only that music which is available on Amazon Music. I'm not a big fan of Amazon Music. It does not have much of my kind of music.Alexa also plays from Jio Savn and Hungama. So getting Alexa to play some music is not always a simple task to perform. And a lot of times, you want Alexa to play an album you saw on Amazon Music or Hungama but the voice assistant fails to find it!I don't have complaints about operating smart appliances with Alexa though. It's totally fun.Edit-1: It has been five months since I started using Echo Dot and I still can't easily find the music I love. On this Independence Day I tried to get Alexa play some classic patriotic songs like \"Jahaan Daal Par Sone Ki...\" but no matter what words I used, Alexa kept playing a playlist called \"Ai Watan\" which seemed to have all new songs, none of which I liked. Clearly, the music that Alexa offers has been selected by Amazon keeping in mind today's teens. And this won't change."},

While the previous gen dot was more of an \"Echo Input\" type functionality, this one can actually serve as a decent speaker. Coming to the software side:1. Apple music not supported in India. In fact the only available services are Amazon music, Saavn and Hungama music2. Amazon music has a very limited catalog and Indian users can't upload their songs either ( apparently US users can do this)3. Spotify not available \"yet\"4. Youtube/ Google play music not supported for obvious reasons5. Because of the above I tried to give Saavn a shot as their catalog is surprisingly large, but then Alexa doesn't support playlists for Saavn.Summary:If you are planning to get an Echo for listening music - stay away from this (or any Echo device for that matter) - at least for now."},

VFM", "review": "I have been using echo dot since it was first launched in India and was available via invite basis. This one I bought to gift. This 3rd gen one has improved on sound. Although the voice recognition I feel was better in 2nd gen. Alexa has matured really well in these many years. The peripheral accessories have improved and most importantly have become cheaper.There should be a version with battery back up, it is a long pending improvement. Amazon should look into this now.Also integration with google (it may never happen, but fingers crossed!) Could be the ultimate goal for Alexa. It will help in direct calling from android, and information system will improve leaps and bounds.Device works perfectly fine, although I was pissed of when I saw that they are using pin charger instead of micro usb now. Which means you need to carry that extra charger wherever you go.Fabric sides feel nice in hands. Microphones works ok. Integration between your firestick and Alexa has become better.I also bought one 4th generation echo dot for myself, and that doesn't sound that much better. Please stick to the 3rd gen if you want VFM echo dot.Finally, it is something you do not need, but it feels nice when it is around. Children loves it. I have almost everything integrated with alexa, lights, fans, vaccum cleaner, Ac.... It can shop for you, it can book cab for you, it can do so many things, but finally you will only use it to listen to songs, please mark my words.So if you want to indulge with technology, if you want to get into an integrated environment, this is for you, you may get better speaker than this in this price range, but it is not just a dumb speaker.

It fails terribly due to lack of thinking by the designers.1. This devise should require a password or PIN or recognize the voice of the person before proceeding further. It should not allow anyone to hijack your device- in my case my 7 year old, who keeps fiddling with the reminders or moving it away from a central location to his room. ( don't tell me you can't do voice classification, then at least ask a PIN ). For me the device is useless now, as I may not even hear it and important reminders may get removed. 2. The India model at least has no working profanity filter, my son plans music with profanity and there is no way to restrict access.3. Searches sometimes fail miserably- it is not recognition, the problem is the content that is being searched for an answer. Google's device is probably is stronger here with search results4. The reminders should have an option to repeat till I turn it off by saying \"acknowledged' or 'done'"},

After using it for a while, i noticed the amazon music service doesn't work at all. I was under the impression that amazon music, which is freely available with echo devices would work. After trying for hours to make it work i gave up, Alexa replied that \"She couldn't find anything\" whenever i tried to play something on amazon music. The only service that works good so far is Hungama Music. I am saying this after testing all the other services like Gaana, JioSaavn, Spotify etc... Gaana works as well but it has some issues... Spotify also works but lacks many songs.Aside from that, the mics are good but only till the volume medium, because high volume makes the device hard to hear us. Anything over volume level 6 is bad, and Alexa won't hear us unless we shout at her. I really liked the 2nd gen which had 7 mics yet this one only offers 4.. which is a downside for me. Hardware wise the sound quality is good until the volume level 8, but anything over that makes the sound distort and would be a pain to hear it.Alexa is on the other hand is good to talk to, she (It) can play music, tell jokes, read stories, sing songs, set alarms, set reminders, control smart devices etc... with the bonus of human like speech. This was the factor made me buy this. But on the downside she lacks too much intelligence compared to her counter part Google assistant.. She can't even answer the basic questions and just forwards us to Wikipedia. I hope amazon continues to improve Alexa.So as a new buyer which one to buy? Alexa or GoogleIf you don't care about how the assistant speaks, (robotic speech vs human like speech) then go for Google assistant speaker. Because Google and Alexa devices can both can do the job for smart homes. But Google uses their vast database infrastructure for information so obviously it will have upper hand in this department.But if you care about how your speaker speaks then go for Alexa.. without thinking anything.If you care about information then go for Google assistant else Alexa should be your preference."},

You have to say Alexa before every question which could be little annoying some times.What it can do?You can play songs for sure, ask questions and it answers you for most of the times, set alarm, alerts. create routine Etc.But I use it mostly for listing songs and alarms and does a good job.Only negative thing that I can say as of now is its bit difficult to give commands at higher volume you really have to shout but in normal it can pick thinest of sound.So all in all its value for money as I got it @2999 in sale."},

This has communication features so people having alexa app or echo device and permission can actually call you on your echo dot.2. This has announcement features so if you are late for dinner you can announce that on your echo device from your phone.(Actually i use this feature to play ghost sounds when little kids are in my room\ud83d\ude1d)3. This has best features for home automations that google home or any other devices don't have.4. This has best features for timer tasks.5. Scheduling is much more advanced in alexa app.6.

Those features can only be placed under the review when they are arranged.However, even then, I will recommend to buy it.

The alexa integration is really good with all the amazing alexa skills available in echo dot. The voice recognition is average coz when the volume is above 5 , alexa couldn't recognize the wake word as the music is loud. So, we would require to shout to let her hear the wake word. I hope this might be resolved in the new (4th) generation as the sound will be focusing in 1 direction rather than 360 degrees, this is what i feel through looking at the design. The response time is good but can be improved in thr next generation yet to be released. Overall, this device is worth the purchase at regular price and during the sale it becomes much more worthy at the price of 2249. There are many hidden features in alexa which are not known by the majority customers like explicit filter, treble base and mid-range regulator, talk slow, talk fast, follow-up mode, sing a song, feedback, Horoscope, movie dialogues, quotes, Translation, excellent mind and strategy games, kids games and fun games like Shadow game, Akinator, Bulls and Cows, Guess the number, Music mania, Yes Sire etc. and many more fabulous features. Please do a little search on Google about Alexa Skills and who knows you may be able to discover some great hidden features or a new feature. Also, at regular intervals, please do ask your alexa to check for software updates and update the device. It will allow you to enjoy new features with every update. Although, Alexa may not be the greatest invention but it is definitely the sweetest invention and yes it's becoming smarter everyday. Alexa is not comparable to other devices like google home, google nest, apple homepod, etc. as they have different features and different price segments. If you need a wide range of features and skills for daily use and fun, Alexa devices are the perfect choices. Believe me, even with those flaws i mentioned, Alexa will be a cheer. Just go for it."},

Alexa isn't as smart as you want it to be and a lot of you questions are responded with \"I don't know that\".If your locality has a lot of power outages it might be a problem specially sense Alexa takes about a couple of minutes to reconnect if it loses power.

And I end up calling 'Alexa\" 3-4 times going closer each time to get the 'attention'. If I had to go all the while to the equipment to say 'Next' or 'reduce volume', what is the benefit over any normal music player !And when it listens, it recognizes wrong atleast half of the time. Initially I thought it is with the regional language (song/movie name), but then found the problem with perfect English dictionary words also (Mercury as Fury and MP3 as MPA). My accent must be really bad !So basically i have to struggle for minutes to get an intended song played.I did get the PLEX server setup in my PC to stream local music to alexa. Not at a level of selecting songs with voice commands yet, but atleast I get a playlist of my choice played.Most of the time I have to use specific commands itself.

However, like Google Nest Home devices, I would like personalized results from voice identification. That would certainly give these device lineup an edge.Spotify device casting is excellent. I find it faster than Google devices. The sound is a bit muffled though due to side firing (?) speaker. I believe one should go for 4th Gen devices from now on.Home automation is a breeze with these devices. I've set up multi room audio and it's one thing that I can say is worth all the money.

Sometimes I am amazed by how well it picks up stuff.6. Kids love it. An added advantage is that they can take help for homework and talking to alexa also motivates them to talk in English"},

His communication was successful, his mother, Bethany, picks up the contact. Now he is trying to tell her a story...the story of how he killed an old man named Richard. He is hurt, he cries in agony while narrating a story to her...He is heard to be repeatedly calling his maternal deity while explaining what and how he did it. Then I guess he gets surrounded by some sub intellectual species called the geralds.

{"name": "Mayapur in Bengal", "stars": "5", "title": "Old Age Personal Assistant", "review": "This review is at the end of the third week of use. I use the Echo Dot 3rd generation for answering questions, setting reminders, alarms, to-do, and shopping lists. I do not use it very often for music. At my age (over 70) and being retired, a person can be more active and busier than ever before. Often we need to remind ourselves to do things such as taking medicine, do my yoga, keep up with my art class, do my accounting, practice my harmonium or other daily tasks accomplished on a schedule. Many times older people have brief thoughts that we need to remember. Remembering that thing you wanted to buy or do from the other day, of which the memory of that usually occurs in situations such as doing the dishes or taking a shower when your hands are wet so writing it down needs to be put off. Now you can yell at Alexa.I\u2019ve told you how I use the Echo Dot, let me tell you how I feel about this purchase. I can\u2019t believe I waited for so long to buy one of these things. The Echo Dot is a huge help for me; it's like having an assistant. I use Alexa and the Echo Dot many times a day for all of its features, including remembering things that may have otherwise gone undone or forgotten.I speak several languages, including proper English and in the last three weeks, the only time Alexa has not understood what I have said is when I have mumbled, garbled or otherwise mispronounced something. Other than those very few times voice recognition has been perfect. The Echo Dot sits on my desk; however, today I ordered a wall holder (the type without the plug just a holder) to mount it on my bookcase right in front of my home desk. The sound coming from the Echo Dot carries far into my residence and is easily heard and understood from a reasonable distance.I downloaded the Amazon Alexa app for my Android phone. You don\u2019t need to use this app in daily use, but you will use it during device setup and review of what you have voiced onto the Echo Dot for lists, alarms, and reminders. You can also hear those by asking Alexa. And thank goodness you don\u2019t need the Alexa app for more than that. It\u2019s awful. I think the word \u201cawful\u201d is the most used in all the reviews. Almost always your Alexa app will say that your Echo Dot is offline when it is never offline. Most of the studies agree with this. So yes, if you buy an Echo Dot, you will download and use the Alexa app, but after setup, I\u2019ve not found any use for it other than to touch the button on my phone to see when the app works and does not work. My Echo Dot works 100% of the time, and if the internet to the house is working the Echo Dot will be working correctly and automatically.This purchase of the Echo Dot has been a big boost for me. I am happy to have moved forward technology-wise with this device. For anyone who wants more productivity in their life, this is a good buy. And now, I have something to say to Alexa before I sign off: Alexa, wake me up from my nap in 30 minutes.90 day update: See picture of the wood stand. Using daily for everything the Echo is designed to do. Voice recognition near perfect. I can have my back to the Echo from across the room and yell out a command no problem. I've added a couple of Skill Blueprints which have been excellent. I am using many reminders which have been a boon to my productivity. Had a local carpenter make a wood stand made for above my desk to hold the Echo Dot and my camera."},

It will not answer to your in general query. And moreover to control your things such as bulb, fan etc you will have to buy those separately that adds additional burden to your pocket. I bought it after hearing a lot about it and I got angry when I felt that it will not work until and unless you connect your Amazon Echo to any wifi network. It also adds another monthly burden to your pocket. Even after spending a lot you will struggle while using it because it will not answer your daily query. I will tell you about my personal experience I asked alexa to remember my birthday and surprisingly it said \"Sorry I didn't know that\". And also I asked alexa to roar like a lion and it did but it was like someone play a low quality audio. I think you would have seen that in one of the advertisement. So last but not the least if you use it regularly you will conclude that you are using Amazon echo just for 2-3 works, playing music (also sound quality is loud but not good) adding alarm and controlling led bulbs if you have bought. So I will suggest you to think wisely because by the time you will decide it is not worth to buy your return period will be over. And if you will ask to me I will say DON'T BUY it rather buy a JBL speaker and it will give you satisfaction whenever you will listen any song."},

Many times it tries to find a song only. !!! It acts desgned for a music playbox most time.Getting a song played out that we intent (sung by my fav singer) is almost no way in many cases. Reminders - voice level cannot be set so I end up creating Routines instead. Many times my kid asks queries and it gives foolish answers. There are no good stories we can get to hear unless we pay for another subscription other than the prime. !!!. The definition it gives is mostly from wikiepedia which it thinks as source of truth.!!.Many times I felt throwing the device to the floor. In a nutshell , this is a dumb musical player created by Amazon SW team. There is no element of intelligence to it. They just integrated it with routines and we can do those routines and play the song (the one , that it decides) . Amazon product team ihasnt improved this device at all in the new generation model."},

Adding to the woes is the electronic items from Amazon which is not a specialist in such items also magnified my negative images for such devices.My eleder brother ordered this device for his use and the lockdown offered me some time to spend with my family including Alexa device. I am writing the review after regular two week use of the devices and my feedback is followingPros-Timely delivery by Amazon.Great packing.Easy to setup the device.Amazing sound quality, I was amazed to see that a pocket fitting devices can produce such loud and clear output.Very prompt reply from the device upon any request.Multi language support.Works very fluently with the mobile hotspot.Smart home integration is awesome.ConsAlexa gets upset sometimes as housewife's do. You just need to set it again.Final verdict- just go for it. It's a super device."},

My experience with CTDI has been nothing short of a nightmare. The CTDI team is impossible to contact, they do not respond to emails and their phone service does not work. After having my device for nearly 5 months , I was sent a redicolous high estimate for repair which costs as much as a new device itself. Not only that , the email coatation is for a fire stick when I sent them an echo dot device. Again no clarification received from them till date even though I have sent a second reminder.My reason to go into such details is that one should never waste ones time with CTDI and what is even more shocking is AMAZON'S attitude once your device is out of warranty.AMAZON arrogantly washes their hands of you and your problem ."},

Excellent Speaker - both as a standalone speaker and smart device (at the price point i got on Prime day)2. Alexa - Has almost no trouble in recognizing voice and very rarely does it falter, plus integration with Amazon ecosystem - You can place order, track deliveries and also receive news updates all via Eco dot.3. Bluetooth - Can even use this as a blue-tooth speaker for iPad / Phone . Does a great job (needs power source though)Cons:1. Portability : A removable USB cable on adapter would have enabled much wider usage (battery bank power?)2. One command at a time - It cannot execute 2 or 3 commands in one go - Like switch on the light, & play music will need you to say \"Alexa\" 2 times. Can be a bit abrupt at times - in starting and stopping music etc.Verdict : Brilliant smart speaker for home use at a great price point."},

Alexa is well integrated and Alexa does the job of playing songs for my toddler and parents quiet well. (This is what it is being used for 90% of the time). Alexa is not as smart as google, but for intended purpose, serves us well.Tried to pair with my firestick, could pair it easily but the fire stick uses this as output device by default, instead of tv speakers and there is noticeable lag between video on tv and sound through echo dot. Does not have option to stream audio through tv speakers and use echo dot just as remote for voice commands. So for now I have unpaired the firestick and the echo dot. Hopefully future updates may fix this. (Lag between video audio would be a very hard thing to fix, but there should be an option to use echo dot as just a voice remote)"},

This was a much needed upgrade for my speakers, and I loved it.I have not separately tested the sound quality of Echo Dot (3rd Gen), but it is definitely better than the 2nd Gen one. It catches up the voice commands really easily far away from the room even when there is ambient noise present.

Negative part of this Echo dot 3rd is it has circular plugin port to echo dot which should be usb 2.0 which 2nd Gen echo dot have plus point here. I think Amazon should change this Power Plugin port to normal USB 2.0 so that we can connect our Smartphone charger cables to it and connect it to any Power bank.

So I would say it\u2019s worth every single penny.Reasons1) If you have prime membership then buy this combo pack during sale day. I got around 56 percent discount. Echo devices can help you with smart switches, smart lights, smart ac, etc. But, if you don\u2019t have prime membership then don\u2019t buy.2). You can control your tv using fire tv stick through echo devices using voice command.So, you need both to perform such task. But incase, you have low budget then I suggest you to buy fire tv. It has built in alexa and can perform smart devices task. But, remember you need to buy subscription separately for fire tv streaming application.3) Oakter switch is not worth the Mrp but if you get a combo deal at good price then buy it.

This is nowhere mentioned in the product description. Also if you have multiple internet connection, it cannot save 2 or more internet connections which could be connected when one is not working and this is my main disappointment. I would not comment on sound quality as there are much more products at this price range which has greater sound quality.Speech recognition is very good, but most of the times it interprets wrong for which song I need. This is irritating most of the times and then I switch to mobile app to play the right song, so having alexa and having a normal bluetooth speaker for me is same, no value addition.

I am using google mini for last 1 year, it is also really good but some diff are really noteworthy. I am living in hostel so I don\u2019t want to disturb my neighbour student in night when I command my echo ,which is far from my bed to switch off my light. In google I have to shout (not loud but still enough) in echo I can just whisper, and it responds every single time. The second thing is during switching off or switching on the light , google repeat the full name of my light for example it shouts \u201d switching on Nikhil Syska bulb\u201d during night if you have forgotten to lower the volume suddenly you will call google \u201c switch of the light \u201c it will shout back \u201c switching off Nikhil Syska bulb \u201c but echo dot just say \u201cok\u201d which way more convenient.Though when it comes to connecting to laptop automatically the scenario is totally opposite , google connects silently just making a ping sound and echo repeats my lappy name.The other thing is buttons in place of touch . I like buttons in place of touch , which make its tough to pick the google , most of the time either it play/ pause the songs or increase / decrease the volume . If I have voice assistance, why would I need touch \ud83d\ude44.Alexa integration- because I use amazon shoping and I have kindle , the integration is very much useful for me . My echo reads my book for me . It remind me if my order is coming today.Portability - it\u2019s shape makes it less beautiful but good in portability.

Although it is overpriced product in my view just because basically for music, news etc. We are spending 4.5 K that really not worth as true price for that product would be 2.5 K considering it's good speakers, echo , bass etc. Its good innovation but it is on developing phase because of following:-1. As many a times Alexa find difficulties to understand our language2. Not many options available for exploring in music only ganna and savaan is available.3. The Amazon Alexa app is the worst, as in case Alexa didn't get the song you are willing to listen, so you can't search that particular song on app4. There is no voice locking system as anybody can change the music by giving command5. Works well with WiFi only .6. You have to connect all time with power plug. No other option. So if lights have gone then it's of no use. Biggest disadvantage I guess because we light shortage is biggest problem n we listen to music/news etc. Only when there is no lights ."},

Sometimes it will not play the song you are telling it to play, it plays a song with similar name. Sometimes you will need to tell song's singer, and movie etc to play songs, which according to me ruins the experience.It need a lot of AI improvements. If you are looking for a very smart speaker then go for Google Home mini or Google Home. It will not satisfy you as a AI but it has better sound quality then Google home mini and it connects with a lot of smart devices which google home mini can't. The choice is yours.Good Speaker :- Echo DotGood AI :- Google Home mini"},

Built quality is very nice and far ahead of hey google----------------After using for about 6 months, My opinion about Alexa is fantastic and quite useful.Now I am two wifi smart bulbs and Alexa is good at receiving instructions.If we ask for specific song we have to be more precise in asking otherwise we have to repeat the processWhile reading from audible it is becoming difficult to instruct to go to particular Page. Some pages we may read and some through audibleI love Alexa. Hundreds of skills can be utilised. Go for it with out any second thoughtReview at the time purchase----------------------------------Fantastic. Able to understand commands. But on the day of installation we found a bit difficult. But as we got used to it ,now we are feeling more comfortable.Suggestions.. Still Alexa has to improve in general knowledge section. Alexa is staring immediately after the wake up word Alexa.. It has to wait for the last word of the command.Example.. If I ask to say about Hrithik Roshan, Instead of saying about Hrithik Roshan it starts playing Hrithik Roshan songs. Even news section also , previously read news paper only it is reading again.But once got used to it ,then it is amazing experience. Go for it right now. Sound quality is awesome. Play with it continuously, then you will come to know how to make use of Alexa."},

E.g. for a command of \"Bhajan\" or \"instrumental lullabies\" it starts with the same song/music and proceeds with the same sequence. Soon it becomes monotonous. This needs improvement4. Identifying voices of the members of the family and offering their types of music.

{"name": "Vikas Malik", "stars": "5", "title": "Awesome Alexa", "review": "My review is based on the experience I have had in the past 24 hours resulting in me ordering second Echo Dot for my parents!!!1) Operations: Getting Echo Dot to start working is quick and simple for those who have a fair idea about various apps. The gadget is controlled by the Amazon Alexa Application which can be downloaded for free from the iOS Apps / Google Play store.2) Adding Skills: Since Alexa works on AI mechanism, we have to add a lot of skills to it since it comes with very few pre-possessed skills. Adding skills or I can say enabling skills will take some time as you have over 10,000 skills to choose from; however, it was simple and fun.3) Voice Recognition: This is really a cool feature since it enables Alexa to identify the user and respond to it accordingly. It takes about 5-10 minutes to add each user voice sample.4) Sound Quality: It is a decent sound quality compared to the price tag Echo Dot is being offered this Summer Sale (Can consider the cashback offer @ 10% as well). The best part is that you can add Bluetooth speakers as I was able to pair my F&D Speaker as well as JBL Flip 4 speaker in a jiffy. Believe you me, it is really quick and easy. Therefore, you may not worry much about the sound quality...5) Features: Since it only 24 hours, I am still exploring the entire range of activities Alexa can perform for you but as I have already spent almost last 10 out of 24 hours fiddling around with the gadget and the associated applications, I can tell the readers that you are in for awesome surprises... I shall not disclose the same to maintain the surprise. As already mentioned, since Alexa has got an Artificial Intelligence, the more you interact with the app, the more it gets acquainted with your usage and adopts response. You also have the option to add or remove the outcome of a command... For Example: consider saying Good Morning Alexa and you can choose the response like wishing good morning, giving you news brief from selected news apps, play selected songs and also change the sequence of response.Just to Conclude: This is a great opportunity to save on a must-have device, and even if those who missed out the deal, don't get disheartened as you won't regret the decision of gifting yourself or your loved ones a great gadget which I am sure will be a part of everyone's day-to-day routine."},

There have been plenty of times where Alexa just does not understand me, or understands me wrong, and that was quite frustrating. I eventually switched the language as the other echo dot I had gifted to my parents used an Indian accent. Once done, it's been pretty smooth sailing and Alexa is quite helpful. I can update my calendar with voice control now. I can also control a LED bulb from syska which came as a bundled deal in one of the Amazon shopping festivals.

I haven't used Google home mini so I can't make comparisons on its hardware.But software wise, Alexa is on par with Google assistant in India as well. Many devices such as Android TVs and smart bulbs support both Alexa and Google assistant without any issues.Bought this for \u20b92999 on the Great Indian festival sale let me some up the pros when compared to 2nd gen echo dot1. There are 4 directional mics as compared to two on the 2nd gen which translates to better and increase range of response to your voice.2. More speakers and they now fire from all around the sides of the echo dot rather than the top which is more louder and clearer than the 2nd gen. They can't be compared to the bigger siblings at this price. It's good enough.3. It has a more rounded finish around the speakers and the top compared to the boxy construction of the 2nd gen. It also has a fabric finish around the speakers which feels aesthetically good.Alexa lives in the cloud, so new features will come to all devices. It works with all the apps mentioned in the pics.Note: Change your preferred music service to Saavn in the Alexa app for a better experience. It has more songs than prime music"},

{"name": "Rahul Gautam", "stars": "2", "title": "Absolutely horrifying experience", "review": "Extremely bad experience with Amazon- Bought this with in combo with fire tv stick and Wipro bulb for 7098 rs. My three previous fire sticks were all for 2600rs during sale instead of 4000rs. This time I was willing to pay 4000 for the stick as echo dot I was getting for 3029 and Wipro bulb for like 100 bucks (699rs otherwise).- Echo dot ran fine for first 3-4 days then I faced mic issues a few times. I felt could be because of other noises, ceiling fan perhaps.- I then tried to run specific lists e.g. I went to Amazon music app, saw the playlist I wanted to play. I asked echo dot to play that list from Amazon music. Instead it kept playing random playlists and a few times it mentioned it didn't recognise that list even though it was right there in front of me on the phone.- I emailed cs for above issue, no response till date. Been 7 days.- As a workaround, I decided to play music from app rather and then cast it on Echo Dot. It kept showing connecting (blue circle kept rolling) but nothing ever happened. Means cast option also didn't work. Being a techie myself, I performed all tech articles from Google, reset device etc., Checked location, what not. Finally, I rang cs and they perfomed a few troubleshooting which didn't work. They informed I would be contacted in 24-48 hours. I mentioned replacement window ends after 48 hours and I want response by then. Wasn't too keen in going for replacement and trouble people so agreed to wait for 48 hours window.- to my surprise, it's been 3 days now, no response. I called cs. Was asked to wait for 48 more hours. I asked for supervisor. He came on call and asked me to wait for his team to perform troubleshooting. I had lost it by then. I asked for replacement and after huge hold and verbal discussions to and fro, supervisor agreed for replacement. But informed I'd be informed in a few hours.- I checked now, I am being issued refund and it cost me 500 rs setback. Whole logic of bundle and save money was absolutely rubbish and Amazon support really destroyed the overall experience.- Having bought items worth in lacs, I wonder if it was all worth it."},

By adding a decent speaker to the Dot, Amazon has made it into a full Echo device and in launching the Input has repositioned it in its device lineup, too.Do not forget to add all the skills, they are great to play around with.

Which you can use from the app. Some of it can't be performed by google even.Things that i didn't like.-Sometimes while playing music on an external speaker echo confuses lyrics with word \"alexa\" and starts taking command. Which happens rarely but it does happens.- Alexa isn't smart enough like the google to take dual commands for i.e play sleep music and stop playing after 20 mins. You have to give one command at a time while google can take both at once.-As a search engine Google will definitely have an upper hand over Alexa but i honestly don't search that much.For me none of the cons are a deal breaker. Alexa will do just fine for a smart speaker."},
